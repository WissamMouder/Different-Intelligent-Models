# Different-Intelligent-Models
This folder, Different-Intelligent-Models, contains different intelligent models built using supervised and unsupervised techniques  It includes the methods I used in each model such as:
# NLP and Cosine Similarity for content-based recommendations

# SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) for user-based recommendations

# Logistic Regression, SVM, and Neural Networks for prediction tasks

# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transfer Learning (ResNet-50) for image-based emotion recognition

# Sequence Processing for music generation

# YOLOv8 for object detection

# Data Analysis and Metric Calculations for advertising performance evaluation
