# Different-Intelligent-Models
This folder, Different-Intelligent-Models, contains different intelligent models built using supervised and unsupervised techniques  It includes the methods I used in each model such as:


 NLP and Cosine Similarity .

SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) .

 Logistic Regression, SVM, and Neural Networks .

 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transfer Learning (ResNet-50) .
 
 Sequence Processing for music generation.

 YOLOv8 for object detection.

 Data Analysis and Metric Calculations for advertising performance evaluation.
