In the same year, they made a film starring Ryan O'Neal, which Elmore Leonard, himself a great film buff, didn't like.  Now, for the newer version, Hollywood  assembled very impressive cast, plus the director George Armitage, who did a pretty good job in 'Grosse Pointe Blank.'  SO ... what happened to this newer film, which is so thin in contents?Not everything is bad, and the star Owen Wilson is not to be blamed.  He plays a very likable small-time thief Jack Ryan, who fell for a gorgeous girl Nancy in Hawaii.  Nancy (played by newcomer Sara Foster) is game for fun, and petty crimes too, but this time the stake is high.  She encourages Jack to steal $200,000 hidden in the house of one rich guy Ray, with whom she is having an affair.  The story is a typical Elmore Leonard.See this great cast.  In addition to Wilson and Foster, you get Morgan Freeman, Gary Sinise, Charlie Sheen, Vinnie Jones, Bebe Neuwirth, Willie Nelson, and Harry Dean Stanton.  The film is entirely shot on location in beautiful Hawaii, so you can enjoy the blue sea and the landscapes.And ... what a thin story!  The main story is too cursorily told to interest us, and the pretty amusing performances of the talented actors are sadly thrown away among the weak plot, which gets lost among the pointless set-pieces.  One example.  Vinnie Jones plays a hot-tempered supervisor of a construction site.  In the middle part of the film, he terrorizes Wilson and Freeman, riding a RV.  The scene happens and ends suddenly, out of the context of the film.  The motives of characters, or the relations between them, often lack enough explanation, leaving us wonder 'who is he, anyway?'I do not know Elmore Leonard's personal reaction to this film.  He must have seen it already, and most probably he didn't like it.  Very sporadically the film shows the unmistakable touch of Leonard's -- good dialogues and unpredictable story -- but you need an ear of Tarantino to make his great books into equally great films.\",\n          \"This film is in fact the story of John Brown and the beginning of the Civil War. The film deals with John Brown in Kansas and how he was defeated there, and then the episode of Harper's Ferry where he is captured and then hanged. But the problem that is discussed all along is the coming Civil War that is felt by some as an inevitable event, and slavery that has to be gotten rid of. The problem of this film is that it is both balanced, the two sides being present in the discussion, but also unbalanced because the anti-slavery side is reduced to some kind of religious fanaticism. The point of view that Lincoln will represent is not present in the film, at least not clearly enough : to get rid of slavery for human and humane reasons, for the very ideal of human rights and human equality, and not for some kind of vengeance of God who can only impose his justice through blood and violence and war. The young Custer, played by Ronald Reagan, is just funny, but he is already a braggard who shows off easily by draping reality in imaginary and self-centered vestment.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU\",\n          \"I'm not one to judge certain aspects of a Jackie Chan film such as story, dilogue, or character development. In all honesty, it doesn't matter in Chan films as long as the action is cool and the movie is entertaining. But I'm sorry to say this(well not really) but even my man Jackie Chan couldn't save this movie. Come on people, Jackie Chan and Jennifer Love Hewit? Who's idea was this? There is really nothing good about this movie. The action was nothing but special effects, the jokes were cheesey, the photography was horrible, and even the outtakes weren't funny. The only reason I gave it one star is because 0 wasn't availible. Jennifer Love Hewit was probably the most annoying character I've seen in a long time which is too bad because she's a good actress. One of the biggest problems with this movie is that it actually could have been cool if (1) Get a better sidekick, (2) Get a regular Joe instead of one of the best action stars in the world, and (3) get a MUCH better script. Trust me, unless you are the most hard core Jackie Chan fan on the planet, you might want to skip this one.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"polarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"pos\",\n          \"neg\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

starring ryan o neal which elmore leonard himself a great film buff didn t like now for the newer version hollywood assembled very impressive cast plus the director george armitage who did a pretty good job in grosse pointe blank so what happened to this newer film which is so thin in contents not everything is bad and the star owen wilson is not to be blamed he plays a very likable small time thief jack ryan who fell for a gorgeous girl nancy in hawaii nancy played by newcomer sara foster is game for fun and petty crimes too but this time the stake is high she encourages jack to steal two hundred zero hidden in the house of one rich guy ray with whom she is having an affair the story is a typical elmore leonard see this great cast in addition to wilson and foster you get morgan freeman gary sinise charlie sheen vinnie jones bebe neuwirth willie nelson and harry dean stanton the film is entirely shot on location in beautiful hawaii so you can enjoy the blue sea and the landscapes and what a thin story the main story is too cursorily told to interest us and the pretty amusing performances of the talented actors are sadly thrown away among the weak plot which gets lost among the pointless set pieces one example vinnie jones plays a hot tempered supervisor of a construction site in the middle part of the film he terrorizes wilson and freeman riding a rv the scene happens and ends suddenly out of the context of the film the motives of characters or the relations between them often lack enough explanation leaving us wonder who is he anyway i do not know elmore leonard s personal reaction to this film he must have seen it already and most probably he didn t like it very sporadically the film shows the unmistakable touch of leonard s good dialogues and unpredictable story but you need an ear of tarantino to make his great books into equally great films\",\n          \"this film is in fact the story of john brown and the beginning of the civil war the film deals with john brown in kansas and how he was defeated there and then the episode of harper s ferry where he is captured and then hanged but the problem that is discussed all along is the coming civil war that is felt by some as an inevitable event and slavery that has to be gotten rid of the problem of this film is that it is both balanced the two sides being present in the discussion but also unbalanced because the anti slavery side is reduced to some kind of religious fanaticism the point of view that lincoln will represent is not present in the film at least not clearly enough to get rid of slavery for human and humane reasons for the very ideal of human rights and human equality and not for some kind of vengeance of god who can only impose his justice through blood and violence and war the young custer played by ronald reagan is just funny but he is already a braggard who shows off easily by draping reality in imaginary and self centered vestment dr jacques coulardeau\",\n          \"i m not one to judge certain aspects of a jackie chan film such as story dilogue or character development in all honesty it doesn t matter in chan films as long as the action is cool and the movie is entertaining but i m sorry to say this well not really but even my man jackie chan couldn t save this movie come on people jackie chan and jennifer love hewit who s idea was this there is really nothing good about this movie the action was nothing but special effects the jokes were cheesey the photography was horrible and even the outtakes weren t funny the only reason i gave it one star is because zero wasn t availible jennifer love hewit was probably the most annoying character i ve seen in a long time which is too bad because she s a good actress one of the biggest problems with this movie is that it actually could have been cool if one get a better sidekick two get a regular joe instead of one of the best action stars in the world and three get a much better script

starring ryan o neal which elmore leonard himself a great film buff didn t like now for the newer version hollywood assembled very impressive cast plus the director george armitage who did a pretty good job in grosse pointe blank so what happened to this newer film which is so thin in contents not everything is bad and the star owen wilson is not to be blamed he plays a very likable small time thief jack ryan who fell for a gorgeous girl nancy in hawaii nancy played by newcomer sara foster is game for fun and petty crimes too but this time the stake is high she encourages jack to steal two hundred zero hidden in the house of one rich guy ray with whom she is having an affair the story is a typical elmore leonard see this great cast in addition to wilson and foster you get morgan freeman gary sinise charlie sheen vinnie jones bebe neuwirth willie nelson and harry dean stanton the film is entirely shot on location in beautiful hawaii so you can enjoy the blue sea and the landscapes and what a thin story the main story is too cursorily told to interest us and the pretty amusing performances of the talented actors are sadly thrown away among the weak plot which gets lost among the pointless set pieces one example vinnie jones plays a hot tempered supervisor of a construction site in the middle part of the film he terrorizes wilson and freeman riding a rv the scene happens and ends suddenly out of the context of the film the motives of characters or the relations between them often lack enough explanation leaving us wonder who is he anyway i do not know elmore leonard s personal reaction to this film he must have seen it already and most probably he didn t like it very sporadically the film shows the unmistakable touch of leonard s good dialogues and unpredictable story but you need an ear of tarantino to make his great books into equally great films\",\n          \"this film is in fact the story of john brown and the beginning of the civil war the film deals with john brown in kansas and how he was defeated there and then the episode of harper s ferry where he is captured and then hanged but the problem that is discussed all along is the coming civil war that is felt by some as an inevitable event and slavery that has to be gotten rid of the problem of this film is that it is both balanced the two sides being present in the discussion but also unbalanced because the anti slavery side is reduced to some kind of religious fanaticism the point of view that lincoln will represent is not present in the film at least not clearly enough to get rid of slavery for human and humane reasons for the very ideal of human rights and human equality and not for some kind of vengeance of god who can only impose his justice through blood and violence and war the young custer played by ronald reagan is just funny but he is already a braggard who shows off easily by draping reality in imaginary and self centered vestment dr jacques coulardeau\",\n          \"i m not one to judge certain aspects of a jackie chan film such as story dilogue or character development in all honesty it doesn t matter in chan films as long as the action is cool and the movie is entertaining but i m sorry to say this well not really but even my man jackie chan couldn t save this movie come on people jackie chan and jennifer love hewit who s idea was this there is really nothing good about this movie the action was nothing but special effects the jokes were cheesey the photography was horrible and even the outtakes weren t funny the only reason i gave it one star is because zero wasn t availible jennifer love hewit was probably the most annoying character i ve seen in a long time which is too bad because she s a good actress one of the biggest problems with this movie is that it actually could have been cool if one get a better sidekick two get a regular joe instead of one of the best action stars in the world and three get a much better script
